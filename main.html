    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>More precisely, Time complexity deals with the amount of time required by the algorithm or program to execute to completion.You may be wondering if we use some precise numbers on the clock to express  efficient.No, the amount of Time required for execution is a mathematical quantity, so  must be represented mathematically, using asymptotic notations like Big O, Big Θ and Big Ω.</p>

    <p>deals with the amount of memory required in a system for a particular algorithm. Now, before we dive deeper into the concept, we must know what auxiliary space is. Auxiliary space is the extra space used by an algorithm, which on adding with the space taken by the input values, gives us O(n).<b>Space Complexity</b> = Auxiliary Space + Space taken by input values</p>
